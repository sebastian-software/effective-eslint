## Installation

To use `@effective/eslint-config` in your project, you need to install it via `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`. Ensure you have ESLint installed in your project; if not, you can install it alongside this package.

```bash
npm install @effective/eslint-config eslint --save-dev
# or
yarn add @effective/eslint-config eslint --dev
# or
pnpm add @effective/eslint-config eslint --dev
```

## Usage

After installation, you can configure ESLint to use @effective/eslint-config by adding it to your .eslintrc file or the ESLint configuration section of your package.json.

```js
{
  "extends": "@effective",
  "rules": {
    // disable or customize as needed
    ...
  }
}
```

## Rules

You can check the [full resolution table here](rules.md) which shows which rules are active and from where.

## Approach

All starts with `eslint:recommended` the built-in recommendations list from [ESLint](https://eslint.org).

### Collections

Effective ESLint incorporates rules from the following collections to establish a comprehensive linting foundation:

1. [XO](https://github.com/xojs/eslint-config-xo): Constituting over 50% of Effective ESLint's preset, XO provides a robust, TypeScript-centric base. It stands out for its thorough approach and specialized focus on TypeScript.
2. [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/): Effective ESLint utilizes the strict and stylistic rules from TypeScript ESLint, opting for the type-enhanced versions. While there is significant overlap with XO rules, XO typically enforces stricter standards, offering finer-grained exceptions and options.

### Framework Collections

Effective ESLint embraces best practices by integrating presets from leading React frameworks:

1. [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/): Focused on React (including JSX-A11Y), the CRA preset offers a well-rounded, common-sense-oriented foundation for React development.
2. [NextJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-next): Specializes in framework-agnostic rules, specifically excluding `@next/plugin`-specific rules.
3. [Remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remix-run/eslint-config): Enhances Effective ESLint's presets with standards from the Remix framework.

### Plugins

Effective ESLint is further enriched by recommended rules from these plugins:

1. [React Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react) & [React Hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks): Integrates all recommended rules not already part of CRA, including warnings on deprecated APIs, the use of string refs, and more.
2. [JSX-A11Y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y): Adopts all recommended accessibility rules from the JSX-A11Y plugin.
3. [Unicorn Plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn): Implements all recommended practices from the Unicorn plugin to promote superior coding patterns.
4. [Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-n): A maintained fork of the original Node.js plugin, with all recommended ESM Node.js rules enabled.
5. [JSDoc](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc): Enables all recommended JSDoc rules, excluding those starting with `required-`. This reflects the TypeScript project's reliance on the type system over extensive JSDoc comments.
6. [RegExp Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-regexp): All recommended RegExp rules are enabled to ensure expressions are both efficient and error-free.

### Focus: React/TypeScript

Effective ESLint globally excludes specific namespaces/plugins to maintain focus and avoid conflicts:

1. `vue/*`: Tailored for ReactJS, hence all Vue-related rules are excluded.
2. `flowtype/*`: Dedicated to TypeScript, omitting all Flowtype-related rules.
3. `@next/*`: Framework-specific rules, such as those from NextJS, are avoided to prevent conflicts in diverse environments.

### Disabled Formatting

Effective ESLint employs Prettier's configuration to disable any stylistic/formatting rules that could conflict with Prettier's guidelines. This encompasses core ESLint rules and those from React and TypeScript plugins.

**Explicitly Unused Plugins:**

- [Import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import): Given its reduced relevance in TypeScript projects, the import plugin is not utilized in most presets nowadays. The [enhanced TS-fork](https://github.com/un-ts/eslint-plugin-import-x) might be a good alternative. It just seems that most rules are more targeted to legacy code than modern TS-code.
