# Priorities

This is the list of priorities from different sources to merge into the "effective" list:

- "xo",
- "ts-strict-typed",
- "ts-stylistic-typed",
- "react-app",
- "react",

There are also these very plugin-specific recommendations:

- "regexp": "recommended"
- "unicorn": "recommended"
- "jsdoc": Available but disabled
- "jsx-a11y": only from CRA preset

Unused plugins:

- "import": Does not seem as relevant in TS code base anymore. Most presets do not actively enable most rules.
